It is available\r\nfrom [here](http://www.aston.ac.uk/eas/research/groups/ncrg/resources/netlab/) and it needs the\r\ndigamma function, a version is available from Tom Minka's 'lightspeed'\r\ntoolbox\r\n[here](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/minka/software/lightspeed/).\r\n\r\nYou should also download the latest version of the NDLUTIL toolbox\r\nutility files [from\r\nhere](/ndlutil/downloadFiles/). Make sure\r\nthat the NDLUTIL has priority over the lightspeed toolboxes as they both\r\ncontain different versions of the logdet function.\r\n\r\nDemos in the Toolbox\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThe toolbox can be used to recreate the experiments in the\r\nbioinformatics paper. However running on full data sets takes overnight\r\non a desktop computer. We therefore suggest that you test the\r\nimplementation using the script.\r\n\r\n```matlab \r\n>> demoOC1gata3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will plot simple results from a reduced version of the OC1 data\r\nset.\r\n\r\n![](demoOC1gata3.png)\r\n\r\ngata3 profile before (blue solid line) and after (red dash line)\r\nanalysis with PCA.
